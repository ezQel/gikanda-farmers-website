            <h3>SL28 <small>(Scott Agricultural Laboratories 28)</small></h3>
            <p>
              SL28 is a popular coffee variety in Kenya and is known for its
              exceptional cup quality. It is prized for its bright acidity, full
              body, and complex flavors, often characterized by fruity and
              floral notes. The variety is suited for medium to high altitudes
              and shows resistance to drought, but is susceptible to the major
              diseases of coffee. SL28 is notable for its rusticity—a quality
              meaning that it can be left untended for years or even decades at
              a time, and then return to successful production.

            <h3>SL34 <small>(Scott Agricultural Laboratories 34)</small></h3>
            <p>
              Similar to SL28, SL34 is another Kenyan coffee variety. It is
              recognized for its good disease resistance and is favored for its
              bright acidity and rich, full-bodied flavor profile. SL34 is
              adapted to high altitude areas with good rainfall. It is
              characterized by dark bronze shoot tipped plants with a few
              green-tipped strains. The laterals have semi-erect habit which
              tend to droop on older primary branches. It was bred in Scott
              Agricultural Laboratories

            <h3>Batian</h3>
            <p>
              Batian is a relatively newer coffee variety in Kenya, developed as
              a disease-resistant and drought-tolerant coffee plant. It was
              created to address the challenges posed by coffee leaf rust (CLR).
              Batian coffee often produces a cup with bright acidity and a
              clean, crisp taste. Batian is a composite variety, mixing three
              different pure line varieties. The varieties involved in the
              original crosses are: SL28,SL34 Rume Sudan, N39, K7, SL4 and the
              Timor Hybrid. Well-adapted for smallholders because of its rare
              combination of being a tall variety with disease resistance and
              resillience (e.g., can cope with low management and adverse
              environmental conditions). Bred by Coffee Research Foundation (now
              Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization, KALRO)

            <h3>Ruiru 11</h3>
            <p>
              Ruiru 11 is another disease-resistant coffee variety, designed to
              withstand common coffee diseases. It has gained popularity in
              Kenya for its ability to yield good-quality coffee while being
              hardy against pests and diseases. To mass propagate Ruiru 11,
              breeders manually pollinate the mother plants with pollen from the
              male parent lines to produce first-generation (F1) hybrid seed.
              This final cross results in hybrid vigor, hence high yield. The
              resulting seeds produce a set of siblings that are mixed together
              and distributed to farmers. This is called a composite
              variety.Because Ruiru 11 relies on hand pollination for mass
              propagation, it has been difficult to produce adequate volumes of
              seed to meet farmer demand.

            <h3>K7</h3>
            <p>
              This coffee variety is known for its resistance to coffee berry
              disease (CBD). It is cultivated in some parts of Kenya, including
              the Mount Kenya region K7 is distinguished by its spreading habit
              on young laterals although older primaries tend to droop. It has
              characteristic medium to narrow leaves with young shoot-tips that
              are light bronze in color. It is suited for lower altitudes where
              coffee leaf rust is prevalent.
